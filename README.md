MarkDraft is a web application designed to seamlessly convert Markdown text, especially the kind generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), into professionally formatted Microsoft Word (.docx) and PDF documents. It addresses the common need to take structured text output from AI tools and quickly prepare it for reports, documentation, or sharing.

**‚û°Ô∏è Try the Live Demo:** [**MarkDraft Live**](https://markdraft.onrender.com/) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
*(Note: The free hosting tier might be slow on the first load or for complex PDF generation due to resource constraints.)*

## üöÄ Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>

Experience MarkDraft in action without installing anything:

üîó **[MarkDraft Live Demo](https://markdraft.onrender.com/)**

**Important Note:** The live demo is hosted on Render's free tier. This means:
*   The service might "sleep" after inactivity, causing the **first load** to take 15-30 seconds.
*   **PDF generation**, especially for large or complex documents, can be **slow or may fail** due to the limited RAM and CPU resources available on the free plan. DOCX conversion is generally much faster and more reliable.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack <a name="technology-stack"></a>

MarkDraft is built with the following technologies:

*   **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
*   **Markdown Parsing:** [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)
*   **HTML to DOCX:** [html-to-docx](https://github.com/privateOmega/html-to-docx)
*   **HTML to PDF:** [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) (using headless Chromium)
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **Deployment:** Primarily targeted for [Render](https://render.com/) (but adaptable)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Usage) <a name="getting-started-usage"></a>

Using the deployed MarkDraft application is straightforward:

1.  **Visit the website:** Go to the [Live Demo URL](https://markdraft.onrender.com/).
2.  **Paste Markdown:** Copy your Markdown text (e.g., from an LLM response) and paste it into the large text area.
3.  **Select PDF Options (Optional):** If converting to PDF, choose your desired page orientation (Portrait or Landscape).
4.  **Click Convert:**
    *   Click the "Create Word (.docx)" button to generate a Word document.
    *   Click the "Generate PDF" button to generate a PDF document.
5.  **Download:** Your browser will automatically start downloading the converted file (e.g., `MarkDraft_converted.docx` or `MarkDraft_portrait.pdf`).

## üíª Local Development Setup <a name="local-development-setup"></a>

To run MarkDraft on your local machine for development or testing:

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nishantkluhera/MarkDraft.git
    cd MarkDraft
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(This step might take a few minutes as it downloads Puppeteer and Chromium)*

3.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *(This executes `node server.js` as defined in `package.json`)*

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `server.js` or the console output).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Render) <a name="deployment-render"></a>

This project is designed for easy deployment on platforms like Render. Here's how to deploy your own instance on Render's free tier:

1.  **Push to GitHub/GitLab:** Make sure your latest code (including the `package-lock.json` file) is pushed to a repository on GitHub or GitLab.
2.  **Create Render Account:** Sign up or log in at [render.com](https://render.com/).
3.  **New Web Service:** Click "New +" -> "Web Service" and connect your repository.
4.  **Configure Settings:**
    *   **Name:** Choose a unique name (e.g., `my-markdraft`).
    *   **Region:** Select a suitable region.
    *   **Branch:** `main` (or your default branch).
    *   **Runtime:** `Node`.
    *   **Build Command:** `npm install`
    *   **Start Command:** `npm start`
    *   **Plan:** Select **Free**.
5.  **Add Environment Variable (Recommended):**
    *   Go to the "Environment" section.
    *   Add `NODE_VERSION` Key with a specific LTS version like `18` or `20` as the Value. This helps ensure compatibility.
    *   Add `NODE_ENV` Key with `production` as the Value.
6.  **Create Web Service:** Click the button to start the deployment.
7.  **Monitor:** Watch the deploy logs. The first build might take several minutes due to the Puppeteer download.
8.  **Access:** Once live, use the `.onrender.com` URL provided.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Free Tier Limitation:** Remember that Puppeteer (for PDF generation) is resource-intensive. Performance on the free tier might be limited, and complex PDF conversions may fail. DOCX is generally more reliable on limited resources.

## üîß Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

The application uses the following environment variables:

*   `PORT`: The port the server will listen on. Render sets this automatically. Defaults to `3000` locally.
*   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for optimized performance (optional but recommended).
*   `NODE_VERSION`: (Render specific) Use to specify the Node.js version for the build environment.
